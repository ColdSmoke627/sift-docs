An international team of forensics experts, led by SANS Faculty Fellow Rob Lee, created the SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation and made it available to the whole community as a public service. The free SIFT toolkit, that can match any modern forensic tool suite, is also featured in SANS' Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response course (FOR 508). It demonstrates that advanced investigations and responding to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open-source tools that are freely available and frequently updated.

Offered free of charge, the SIFT 3.0 Workstation will debut during SANS' Advanced Computer Forensic Analysis and Incident Response course (FOR508) at DFIRCON. SIFT 3.0 demonstrates that advanced investigations and responding to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open-source tools that are freely available and frequently updated.

“Even if SIFT were to cost tens of thousands of dollars, it would still be a very competitive product,” says, Alan Paller, director of research at SANS. “At no cost, there is no reason it should not be part of the portfolio in every organization that has skilled forensics analysts.”  

Developed and continually updated by an international team of forensic experts, the SIFT is a group of free open-source forensic tools designed to perform detailed digital forensic examinations in a variety of settings. With over 100,000 downloads to date, the SIFT continues to be the most popular open-source forensic offering next to commercial source solutions.  

“The SIFT Workstation has quickly become my "go to" tool when conducting an exam. The powerful open source forensic tools in the kit on top of the versatile and stable Linux operating system make for quick access to most everything I need to conduct a thorough analysis of a computer system," said Ken Pryor, GCFA  Robinson, IL Police Department
