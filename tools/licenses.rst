==========

The SANS Investigative Forensic Tookit is a linux distribution, a collection of many applications and scripts, all with various licenses. Most tools and scripts are installed via debian packages that are presumably built by their authors, however some packages are not built by the original authors. 

Below is an attempt to identify some of the tools that are known to not be built by the original author but by someone in the community. While these tools exist on SIFT, they have their own project website and associated licenses. Not all tools will be listed here.
